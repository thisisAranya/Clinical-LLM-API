# Simple MedQA-GPT: GPT Tailored for Medical Q&A

This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of fine-tuning a lightweight GPT-2 model for clinical question answering and deploying it as a REST API.

## ✨ Features

- Fine-tunes a **GPT-2** model on custom clinical QA data  
- Uses Hugging Face `Trainer` within a Jupyter Notebook  
- FastAPI backend for real-time inference  
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prepare your dataset

Ensure your training file (`med_qa.jsonl`) follows this format (one JSON object per line):

```json
{"instruction": "Describe symptoms of eczema", "output": "Itchy, inflamed skin, often red and dry."}
```

The dataset used in this project is available in the `Notebook` folder of this repository.

### 2. Fine-tune the model

Open the Jupyter notebook located at `Notebook/medqa_train.ipynb`.  
Run all cells to train and save the fine-tuned GPT-2 model.  
You can push the trained model to your Hugging Face account for backup and reuse.

Example trained model: [Aranya31/gpt2-medqa-ft](https://huggingface.co/Aranya31/gpt2-medqa-ft)

### 3. Build and run the API server

```bash
docker build -t simple-medqa-gpt .
docker run -p 8000:8000 simple-medqa-gpt
```

### 4. Query the API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/infer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Patient has a persistent rash and fever"}'
```
